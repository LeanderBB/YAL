Short Todo:
##########

[ ] Revise Pointer usage in Syntax tree
[ ] Have reusable vectors in STParsers. Make it so that the vector data
is then moved to the respective class
[ ] Do not keep the whole file in memory, create a string pool to reference
any string during compilation
[ ] Auto insert clamping cast operations between integer conversions.
we will then be able to allow casting between all integer types as long as 
it is explicit
[ ] Check for recursive types in struct decls.


Long Term Todo:
###############
[ ] Language server support
[ ] Make frontend felixbile enough to recompile from an existing state 
+ changes
